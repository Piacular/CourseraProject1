W Scott Warner - Evening Campsite:

Description:

This is a scene in which a small campsite is situated in a clearing of a forest. There is a tileable grass texture on the ground plane, a campfire which provides some animated light, several trees and boulders and a night sky skybox (For some reason the skybox has a seam along its edges, I will have to make adjustments to fix that eventually. All of the assets were found for free in the unity store. I followed along with the animation class and added an animation to a small shrub to the left of the starting viewpoint, and also to the point of light which the campfire has. I plan to add more trees, a moon asset relative to the directional lighting, and some nature sounds and the campfire sound.

Instructions:

As this is a scene without any interaction, there are no explicit instructions, just take a glance at the surroundings and tell me what you think! There is only one scene file here, so there should be no confusion about which one to view.

Restrictions:

I built the scene using the VR template available when creating a new project. I have a Valve Index and the headset worked fine when I tried to playtest it. I don't have access to any other headsets or a mobile VR device (like cardboard) so I can't playtest it and guarantee that it will work for those systems, however the documentation of the VR Template in Unity suggests that most headsets should be able to view the scene just fine.
